	<p>I use the knowledge and stories that data provide to track program effectiveness and advocate for the needs of those who get left behind. I'm a data scientist.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>At the start of my career, I advocated for and created strategies or projects with a lens on social inclusion and a focus on the needs of community partners. During that time, I also learned to appreciate the power of numbers, data visualizations, and clear outcomes in explaining program impact and telling effective success stories. I am pursuing a Masters of Data Science to increase my capacity for analysis and data storytelling with training in statistics, Python, R, and Tableau, among other modalities. I am interested in the use of data to tackle social and international development issues, optimize program impact, and increase the transparency and credibility of organizations.</p>

<h2>My Travels</h2>
<p>In the era before the novel coronavirus, I enjoyed living in and traveling to a variety of places. Here are some pictures from places I've been:</p>
