</div>

<p> This website intentionally showcases fonts created by women designers. They are all shown here in their respective names. Audrey, designed by Cristina Pagnotta, was inspired by Audrey Hepburn. The Latin and Tamil script of Catamaran, designed by Pria Ravichandran, is named after a water vessel with a long history in the Dravidian culture of South India. Montserrat Alternates, designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, is a sister family of Montserrat, which captures the typeface of old posters in the Argentine neighborhood where she lives. To learn more about the homogeneity of the typography industry, some insidious and inspiring histories behind different fonts, and the work of various designers, who do not fit in the monolith, refer to the writings of <a href ="https://www.ceros.com/inspire/blog/bipoc-designers-font-typeface/">Eliza Martin</a>, <a href ="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/tre-seals-is-turning-typography-into-a-radical-act/">Silas Munro</a>, and <a href ="https://www.kellydiels.com/feminist-marketing-tool-731-fonts-feminist-issue/">Kelly Diels</a>.</p>

  <figcaption>
    A black woman in a voluminous pale peach gown looks down and to her left. Her chin rests on her left hand which has a wrist wrapped in pearls. In her right hand is a small bouquet of lilacs, which she holds lightly against her left side. Her rosy cheeks seem to glow. </figcaption>

<p>The palette of this website was first inspired by <a href = "http://www.fabiolajeanlouis.com/">Fabiola Jean-Louis'</a> The Color Purple, shown here. Its warm colors and the grace of the woman adorned moved me. It is a nod to the Alice Walker novel of the same name and to Haiti, as well. Mixing the main colors in the flag of Haiti - the Pearl of the Antilles and the first Black Republic - also creates purple. </p>
